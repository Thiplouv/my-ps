# My-PS Project
> Welcome to the my-ps project ! The goal of this project is to dig into Linux concepts by rewriting as many functions as possible of the popular UNIX command line tool ps.

The ps tool report a snapshot of the current processes. 

Here is the man page of ps, in french because my system is configured in la langue de Moli√®re.

## About Me

My name is Thibault Plouviez. I am a 18 years old computer science student, based in Paris (France).

I have a passion for Linux for a lot of time, and I always want to learn more. 

I do think digging into kernel and /proc/ filesystem will be very fun !
